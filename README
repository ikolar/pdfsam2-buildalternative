Unofficial bash script that builds the enhanced version of
pdfsam (pdf split and merge)

Run like this:
 $ bash build.sh

It will:
 1. download the source zip
 2. extract, twice*
 3. compile everything to out/
 4. copy non-class resources to out/ as well
 5. build a jar
 6. copy it and the dependencies to dist/
 7. run a test (ConsoleClient -version)
 8. leave a README in dist/ with an example 
 9. clean up behind itself
